# Dockerized React App: A Practical Guide üê≥üöÄ

This repository contains a sample React application that has been containerized using Docker. The purpose of this project is to help developers learn and practice Docker concepts while working with a React application. By following this guide, you'll understand how to streamline your development and deployment processes using Docker and React together.

### Prerequisites
To follow along with this guide, you'll need the following installed on your machine:

Node.js

npm

Docker

Docker Compose

### Getting Started
Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:

`git clone https://github.com/username/dockerized-react-app.git
cd dockerized-react-app`

Install the dependencies:
`npm install`

Start the development server:
`npm start`

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the React app running.

## Dockerizing the React App
Create a Dockerfile in the project root directory.
Add the following content to the Dockerfile:

```
# Use an official Node.js runtime as a parent image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json into the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install any needed packages
RUN npm install

# Copy the app source code into the working directory
COPY . .

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 3000

# Define the command to run the app
CMD ["npm", "start"]
`
```

Building the Docker Image
Build the Docker image by running the following command in your project directory:

`docker build -t your-image-name .`

Running the Docker Container
Start a Docker container using the image you just built:
`docker run -p 3000:3000 --name your-container-name your-image-name`

Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the containerized React app running.

Docker Compose

To start the container using Docker Compose, run:

`docker-compose up`

## Deploying the Application
This guide doesn't cover deploying the containerized React application, but you can find resources online to help you deploy to various platforms, such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku.
